## Exploring the MNIST dataset

Using this notebook to test the performance of various machine learning algorithms on the digit recognition MNIST dataset. 

Besides testing this on the vanilla test set, I hope to see whether the trained model is able to recognise student written digits, especially those written on exam scripts. 

The aim is to see whether we can emulate the performance of an OCR reader with machine learning algorithms.
